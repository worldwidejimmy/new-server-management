# SendGrid Email Setup Guide for kludgebot.com

## Overview
This guide walks through setting up SendGrid to send authenticated emails from `johnny@kludgebot.com` through Gmail, solving the "unverified sender" problem.

## Why SendGrid?

**Problem:** Regular Gmail accounts cannot properly authenticate custom domain emails with DKIM, resulting in "unverified sender" warnings.

**Solution:** SendGrid provides free SMTP relay with proper DKIM/SPF authentication.

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Free tier: 100 emails/day forever
- ‚úÖ Proper DKIM signing
- ‚úÖ No "unverified sender" warnings
- ‚úÖ Better deliverability to Gmail/other providers
- ‚úÖ Works with Gmail's "Send mail as" feature

## Port 25 Block Issue

Our OVH VPS has outbound SMTP ports blocked:
- Port 25: BLOCKED ‚ùå
- Port 465: BLOCKED ‚ùå
- Port 587: BLOCKED ‚ùå

This means we cannot run our own Postfix server to send emails directly. SendGrid solves this by providing an external relay service.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create SendGrid Account

1. Go to: https://signup.sendgrid.com/
2. Sign up for free account (no credit card required)
3. Verify your email address

**Important:** The "trial" messaging is misleading - the free tier (100 emails/day) is permanent. Just don't add a credit card.

### 2. Domain Authentication

In SendGrid dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication** ‚Üí **Authenticate Your Domain**
2. Select "Other Host" (we use Cloudflare)
3. Enter domain: `kludgebot.com`
4. Enable **Link Branding** (free, makes links show your domain)

### 3. Add DNS Records to Cloudflare

SendGrid will provide DNS records. Add these to Cloudflare DNS:

**CRITICAL: All records must be GRAY CLOUD (DNS only), not orange proxy!**

#### CNAME Records (already added):
```
Type    Name                          Value
CNAME   56740961.kludgebot.com       sendgrid.net
CNAME   em5571.kludgebot.com         u56740961.wl212.sendgrid.net
CNAME   s1._domainkey.kludgebot.com  s1.domainkey.u56740961.wl212.sendgrid.net
CNAME   s2._domainkey.kludgebot.com  s2.domainkey.u56740961.wl212.sendgrid.net
CNAME   url6963.kludgebot.com        sendgrid.net
```

#### Update SPF Record:

**Current SPF:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

**Updated SPF (add SendGrid):**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net ~all
```

**To update in Cloudflare:**
1. Go to DNS records for kludgebot.com
2. Find TXT record with `v=spf1`
3. Edit and add `include:sendgrid.net` before `~all`
4. Save

#### DMARC Record:
Already exists from Cloudflare Email Routing setup:
```
_dmarc.kludgebot.com ‚Üí "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:d0073d3c6661414fa6f7388426e0bafc@dmarc-reports.cloudflare.net"
```

### 4. Verify in SendGrid

1. Wait 2-5 minutes for DNS propagation
2. In SendGrid, click **"Verify"** on the domain authentication page
3. All records should turn green ‚úÖ

### 5. Create API Key for SMTP

1. In SendGrid: **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Name it: `Gmail SMTP` or similar
4. Permissions: **Full Access** (or at minimum "Mail Send")
5. Copy the API key (you'll only see it once!)

### 6. Add to Gmail

In Gmail Settings:
1. Click gear icon ‚Üí **See all settings**
2. Go to **Accounts and Import** tab
3. In "Send mail as" section, find `johnny@kludgebot.com`
4. Click **"edit info"**
5. Update SMTP settings:
   - **SMTP Server:** `smtp.sendgrid.net`
   - **Port:** `587`
   - **Username:** `apikey` (literally the word "apikey")
   - **Password:** (paste your SendGrid API key)
   - **Secured connection:** TLS
6. Save changes

If you don't have the "Send mail as" set up yet:
1. Click **"Add another email address"**
2. Enter: `johnny@kludgebot.com`
3. Use the SMTP settings above
4. Verify the email address

### 7. Test It!

1. In Gmail, compose a new email
2. Click the "From" dropdown
3. Select `johnny@kludgebot.com`
4. Send a test email to yourself
5. Check the email headers - should show:
   - ‚úÖ DKIM: PASS
   - ‚úÖ SPF: PASS
   - ‚úÖ No "unverified sender" warning

## Current DNS Configuration

See full DNS export in `kludgebot.com.txt` or `kludgebot.com (1).txt`

**Key records:**
- SPF: Includes Cloudflare, Google, and SendGrid
- DKIM: Cloudflare (`cf2024-1._domainkey`) + SendGrid (`s1`, `s2._domainkey`)
- DMARC: Cloudflare Email Routing reports
- MX: Cloudflare Email Routing

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Unverified sender" still shows
- Check SPF includes `sendgrid.net`
- Verify all SendGrid DNS records are added correctly
- Wait 24 hours for DNS propagation
- Make sure records are GRAY CLOUD in Cloudflare

### Emails not sending
- Verify API key is correct
- Check you haven't exceeded 100 emails/day
- Verify domain authentication is complete in SendGrid
- Check SendGrid Activity feed for errors

### Gmail won't accept SMTP settings
- Username must be exactly `apikey` (not your email)
- Password is the API key from SendGrid
- Port must be 587 with TLS
- Make sure you generated an API key with Mail Send permissions

### SendGrid verification fails
- Ensure CNAME records are DNS only (gray cloud)
- Wait 5-10 minutes after adding DNS records
- Check for typos in DNS record names/values
- Verify no duplicate records exist

---

## Free Tier Limits

**SendGrid Free Plan:**
- 100 emails per day (forever)
- No credit card required
- Full SMTP access
- Domain authentication included
- Link branding included

**After "trial" ends (Dec 14, 2025):**
- Automatically becomes permanent free plan
- Same 100 emails/day limit
- No charges as long as no credit card on file
- Ignore "invoice" messaging - it's just standard wording

---

## Alternative Options Considered

### 1. Keep using Gmail SMTP
- ‚ùå "Unverified sender" warning persists
- ‚ùå Lower deliverability
- ‚úÖ Easy, no changes

### 2. Run own Postfix server on VPS
- ‚ùå OVH blocks all outbound SMTP ports
- ‚ùå Would need to request unblocking (takes time, may be denied)
- ‚úÖ Full control if ports were unblocked

### 3. Google Workspace
- ‚úÖ Proper DKIM signing
- ‚úÖ Professional features
- ‚ùå $6-18/month cost

### 4. Cloudflare Email Routing
- ‚ùå Receive-only, no outbound SMTP
- ‚úÖ Good for forwarding incoming mail

**SendGrid was chosen as the best balance of cost (free), functionality, and ease of setup.**

## Node.js Integration (Future)

To send emails from Node.js apps using SendGrid:

```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const msg = {
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  from: 'johnny@kludgebot.com',
  subject: 'Hello from Node.js',
  text: 'Email body',
  html: '<strong>Email body</strong>',
};

sgMail.send(msg);
```

Or use Nodemailer with SendGrid SMTP:

```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: 'apikey',
    pass: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY
  }
});

transporter.sendMail({
  from: 'johnny@kludgebot.com',
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Hello from Node.js',
  text: 'Email body'
});
```
